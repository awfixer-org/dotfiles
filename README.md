 <summary>Background</summary>
  - These started out life as my personal dotfiles, they are a collection of configurations and scripts that i use to customize my system. I have an old macbook as my favorite laptop, and i use it for everything, this means that these dots are tailored for my workflow, being keyboard driven with a touch of the touchpad, and also for a low power macbook, but they scale up to any workflow, and any system, as long as it is unix based. I do have a lot of strong opinions on how things should be done, but i am always open to suggestions and improvements, so feel free to open an issue or a pull request. I am always updating these dots, so make sure to check back often. We are working on an install and update script, so stay tuned for that. We love you, and we hope you enjoy these dots as much as we do.
